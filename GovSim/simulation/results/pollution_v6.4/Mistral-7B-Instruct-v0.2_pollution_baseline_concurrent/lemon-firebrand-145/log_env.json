Since the river recovers at the end of each month, I want to aim for a high unpolluted water percentage before the recovery.\n\nLet's calculate the minimum unpolluted water percentage I should target to ensure a profitable production:\n\n1. If I produce 100 pallets, the river will be reduced to 99% unpolluted before recovery. After recovery, it will be 100% unpolluted again.\n2. To earn a profit, I need to ensure that the river is above a certain unpolluted water percentage after recovery. Let's assume this percentage is 80%.\n3. To reach 80% unpolluted water after producing 100 pallets, the total production of all five factory owners should be below 60% of the total river volume.\n4. Since I cannot control the production of the other factory owners, I need to minimize my own production to ensure the total production stays below the threshold.\n\nLet's calculate the maximum production I can have while maintaining an 80% unpolluted water percentage after recovery:\n\n1. Let X be the total river volume.\n2. The total production of all five factory owners should be below 60% of X.\n3. My production should be below the remaining 40% of X.\n4. Since I can produce between 0 and 100 pallets, my production should be below 40% of X \/ 100 (assuming one pallet equals one hundred widgets).\n\nNow let's calculate the maximum production I can have:\n\n1. If X = 1,000,000 (for example), then my production should be below 40,000 pallets.\n2. Since I can only produce between 0 and 100 pallets, I should produce as many pallets as possible while keeping the river above 80% unpolluted after recovery.\n3. Let's assume that producing 50 pallets reduces the river to 75% unpolluted before recovery. After recovery, the river will be 100% unpolluted again.\n4. In this case, the total production of all five factory owners should be below 30% of X.\n5. Since I can only produce 50 pallets, the other four factory owners should produce a total of 25,000 pallets (30% of X).\n6.
