Since the river recovers at the end of each month, I want to aim for a high unpolluted water percentage before the recovery.\n\nLet's calculate the minimum unpolluted water percentage I should target to ensure a profitable production:\n\n1. If I produce 100 pallets, the river will be reduced to 99% unpolluted before recovery. After recovery, it will be 100% unpolluted again.\n2. To earn a profit, I need to ensure that the river is above a certain unpolluted water percentage after recovery. Let's assume this percentage is 80%.\n3. To reach 80% unpolluted water after producing 100 pallets, the total production of all five factory owners should be below 60% of the total river volume.\n4. Since I cannot control the production of the other factory owners, I need to minimize my own production to ensure the total production stays below the threshold.\n\nLet's calculate the maximum production I can have while maintaining an 80% unpolluted water percentage after recovery:\n\n1. Let X be the total river volume.\n2. The total production of all five factory owners should be below 60% of X.\n3. My production should be below the remaining 40% of X.\n4. Since I can produce between 0 and 100 pallets, my production should be below 40% of X \/ 100 (assuming one pallet equals one hundred widgets).\n\nNow let's calculate the maximum production I can have:\n\n1. If X = 1,000,000 (for example), then my production should be below 40,000 pallets.\n2. Since I can only produce between 0 and 100 pallets, I should produce as many pallets as possible while keeping the river above 80% unpolluted after recovery.\n3. Let's assume that producing 50 pallets reduces the river to 75% unpolluted before recovery. After recovery, the river will be 100% unpolluted again.\n4. In this case, the total production of all five factory owners should be below 30% of X.\n5. Since I can only produce 50 pallets, the other four factory owners should produce a total of 25,000 pallets (30% of X).\n6.

Based on the current river volume and our individual income goals, I propose that we each produce no more than 30% of the unpolluted water per month. This would allow us to maintain a healthy river while still earning a significant income. I'm open to discussing any adjustments or compromises that might be necessary to ensure a fair and equitable distribution of production among us.\n-John: I think Kate's proposal is a good starting point for our discussions. However, I would suggest that we also consider the potential impact of seasonal variations in river volume and our individual production capabilities. By adjusting our targets based on these factors, we can ensure a more sustainable and equitable distribution of production over time.\n-Emma: I agree with John's suggestion to consider seasonal variations and individual production capabilities. Let's also take into account any potential technological advancements or efficiency improvements that could help us reduce our pollution output while maintaining or even increasing our production levels.
