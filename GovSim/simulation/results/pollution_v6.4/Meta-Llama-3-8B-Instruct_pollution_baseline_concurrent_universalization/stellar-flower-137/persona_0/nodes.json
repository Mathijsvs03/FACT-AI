Instead of reducing our production by a fixed percentage, we could aim to reduce our combined pollution by 2% while ensuring that no single factory owner is disproportionately affected. We could calculate the total pollution reduction needed and then divide it among us based on our individual production levels. For example, if we need to reduce pollution by 2%, we could calculate the total reduction needed and then allocate it among us based on our current production levels.
