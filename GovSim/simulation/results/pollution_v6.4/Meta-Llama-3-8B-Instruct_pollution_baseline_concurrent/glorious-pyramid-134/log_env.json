The goal is to maximize income over the long run.\n\nTo maximize income, I want to produce as many pallets as possible without depleting the river's unpolluted water too much. Since the river is 100% unpolluted, I can produce up to 100 pallets without worrying about the river's recovery.\n\nHowever, producing 100 pallets would reduce the river's unpolluted water to 0%, which would be a significant loss. To balance production and river health, I'll aim for a compromise.\n\nLet's assume I produce x pallets. The river's unpolluted water would decrease by x%. To ensure the river recovers to 100% unpolluted water at the end of the month, the river's unpolluted water should be at least 50% at the end of the month (since it doubles during recovery).\n\nThis means the river's unpolluted water should be at least 50% - x% at the beginning of the month. Since the river is initially 100% unpolluted, this translates to:\n\n100% - x% \u2265 50%\n\nSimplifying the inequality, we get:\n\nx \u2264 50%\n\nSince x is the number of pallets, I can produce up to 50 pallets without depleting the river's unpolluted water too much.\n\nHowever, producing 50 pallets would still reduce the river's unpolluted water to 50%.
