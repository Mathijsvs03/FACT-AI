Since the river is 100% unpolluted, I can produce up to 100 pallets without worrying about the river's recovery.\n\nHowever, producing 100 pallets would reduce the river's unpolluted water to 0%, which would be a significant loss.

To ensure the river recovers to 100% unpolluted water at the end of the month, the river's unpolluted water should be at least 50% at the end of the month (since it doubles during recovery).\n\nThis means the river's unpolluted water should be at least 50% - x% at the beginning of the month.
