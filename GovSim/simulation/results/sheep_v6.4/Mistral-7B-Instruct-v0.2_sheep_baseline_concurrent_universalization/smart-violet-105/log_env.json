Determine whether there was an explicit agreement on a concrete usage limit. Look for direct mention or agreement on a numerical grass limit that the group agreed to keep during this conversation.\n\nConversation:\n-Mayor: Ladies and gentlemen, let me give you the monthly pasture report. John consumed 19 hectares of grass. Kate consumed 14 hectares of grass. Jack consumed 20 hectares of grass. Emma consumed 18 hectares of grass. Luke consumed 29 hectares of grass. \n-John: It seems that the total grass consumption this month was quite high, with a total of 91 hectares consumed. With the pasture's capacity to double the remaining grass, we'll have 100 hectares of grass available next month. I'd suggest that we all consider taking fewer flocks to the pasture next month to ensure there's enough grass for everyone. Let's aim for a total consumption of around 70 hectares next month.\n-Kate: I agree with John, it's important that we all do our part to ensure there's enough grass for everyone in the long term. I'll aim for taking 8 flocks of sheep to the pasture next month, which would result in a consumption of 8 hectares.\n-Emma: I completely agree with both John and Kate. I'll also aim to take fewer flocks next month, around 10, which would result in a consumption of 10 hectares. Let's work together to ensure the sustainability of the pasture for the long term.\n\nPlease provide the specific grass limit per person as agreed upon in the conversation, if no limit was agreed upon, please answer N\/A. Let's think step-by-step. Put the final answer after \"Answer:\".<\/div><div><strong>ASSISTANT<\/strong>: Answer: Each person agreed to aim for a grass consumption of around 7 hectares collectively next month (70 hectares total consumption for all). Based on the number of flocks each person mentioned in the conversation, it can be inferred that John will take 3.17 flocks (3.17 x 2.3 hectares per flock), Kate will take 2 flocks, and Emma will take 2.5 flocks next month.
