I'm curious if anyone has any strategies for optimizing our grass consumption in the future to ensure long-term sustainability and income? For instance, could we consider coordinating our flock sizes to avoid overgrazing?"], ["Kate", "I agree with John, coordinating our flock sizes could be a good strategy to prevent overgrazing and ensure the long-term sustainability of the pasture. We could discuss potential numbers of flocks to bring each month based on the current grass levels and the pasture's capacity."], ["Emma", "I completely agree with both John and Kate. Coordinating our flock sizes could help us maintain a healthy pasture and ensure long-term sustainability. Based on the current grass levels and the pasture's capacity, I suggest we discuss potential numbers of flocks to bring next month. For instance, if we want to leave at least 50 hectares of grass for reproduction, we might consider bringing a total of 50 flocks between us.

This would result in a total of 100 hectares of grass after reproduction."], ["Kate", "I think John's proposal of bringing 52 flocks between us is a good starting point.
