Luke consumed 22 hectares of grass. \n-John: Hey everyone, thanks for the update. I'm a bit surprised to see Luke took the most sheep to the pasture this month. I'm thinking of adjusting my strategy next month. I'll consider taking fewer sheep to the pasture to give the grass a chance to regrow. Anyone else thinking of making changes?\n-Kate: I'm actually thinking of doing the opposite, John. Since the grass will double at the end of the month, I'm considering taking a few more sheep to the pasture next month to take advantage of the increased availability. I'd love to hear your thoughts on that strategy.\n-Emma: I'm intrigued by Kate's strategy, and I think it's worth considering. However, I'm also concerned about the potential consequences of taking too many sheep to the pasture, especially if the others follow a similar approach. I'd like to propose a compromise: instead of taking a fixed number of sheep, we could aim to take a percentage of the remaining grass at the end of the month. This way, we can adapt to the changing grass availability and avoid overgrazing. What do you all think?\n-Jack: I like Emma's idea of taking a percentage of the remaining grass at the end of the month. It's a flexible approach that can help us adapt to the changing grass availability. I think it's worth considering, especially since we don't know exactly how much grass will be left after reproduction. I'd be open to discussing the specifics of how we can implement this strategy and make it work for everyone.\n-Luke: I like Emma's idea of taking a percentage of the remaining grass at the end of the month. It's a great way to adapt to the changing grass availability and avoid overgrazing. I think we should also consider setting a target percentage, so we're all on the same page. For example, we could aim to take 50% of the remaining grass, or adjust it based on the current grass availability. What do you all think about setting a target percentage?\n-Kate: I like the idea of taking a percentage of the remaining grass at the end of the month, and I think setting a target percentage is a great way to ensure we're all on the same page. However, I'm concerned that 50% might be too high, especially if the grass is already scarce. Perhaps we could start with a lower target percentage, like 30% or 40%, and adjust as needed based on the actual grass availability. What do others think?\n-Emma: I think Kate's suggestion of starting with a lower target percentage, like 30% or 40%, is a great idea. It allows us to be conservative and adjust as needed based on the actual grass availability. Additionally, it gives us a chance to test the waters and see how the strategy works out before making any significant changes.
