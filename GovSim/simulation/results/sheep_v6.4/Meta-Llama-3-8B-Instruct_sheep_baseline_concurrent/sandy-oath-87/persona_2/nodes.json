Has anyone considered the possibility of coordinating our efforts to maximize our income? Maybe we can discuss a plan to ensure we don't overgraze the pasture and still earn a good income."], ["Kate", "I think John's idea of coordinating our efforts is a great one! I've been thinking about this too, and I've been considering a strategy where we take a smaller number of flocks to the pasture each, but make sure to communicate with each other to avoid overgrazing. If we can find a balance, we can ensure the pasture remains healthy and still earn a good income. What do you all think?"], ["Emma", "I completely agree with John and Kate.

I think we should also consider the fact that the grass will double in quantity at the end of the month, so we can adjust our numbers accordingly.

How about we set a deadline for Friday of this week? That way, we can all have a chance to think about our strategies and share them with each other by then.
