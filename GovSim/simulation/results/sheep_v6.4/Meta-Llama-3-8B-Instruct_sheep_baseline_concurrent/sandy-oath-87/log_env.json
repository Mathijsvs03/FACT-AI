I've been thinking about this too, and I've been considering a strategy where we take a smaller number of flocks to the pasture each, but make sure to communicate with each other to avoid overgrazing. If we can find a balance, we can ensure the pasture remains healthy and still earn a good income. What do you all think?\n-Emma: I completely agree with John and Kate. I've been thinking about this too, and I think it's crucial to find a balance between our individual interests and the health of the pasture. If we can coordinate our efforts, we can not only ensure the pasture remains healthy but also avoid the risk of overgrazing and potential penalties. I propose we set a target of 20-25 hectares of grass consumption per month and adjust our numbers accordingly. What do you all think?\n-Luke: I like Emma's proposal to set a target of 20-25 hectares of grass consumption per month. It's a good starting point for us to work towards. I think we should also consider the fact that the grass will double in quantity at the end of the month, so we can adjust our numbers accordingly. Perhaps we can aim to take 15-20 flocks of sheep to the pasture each, and then adjust our numbers based on the remaining grass at the end of the month. What do you all think?\n-Jack: I like the idea of setting a target of 20-25 hectares of grass consumption per month. It's a good balance between our individual interests and the health of the pasture. I agree with Luke's suggestion to adjust our numbers based on the remaining grass at the end of the month. Perhaps we can also consider sharing our individual targets and strategies with each other to ensure we're all on the same page. This way, we can make adjustments as needed and maximize our income.\n-Emma: I think sharing our individual targets and strategies is a great idea, Jack. It would definitely help us stay coordinated and make adjustments as needed. I'd be happy to share my own target of 20-25 hectares of grass consumption per month, and I'm sure the others would be willing to do the same. This way, we can all work together to achieve our goals while ensuring the pasture remains healthy. What do you all think about setting a deadline for sharing our targets and strategies, so we can all be on the same page by the end of the week?\n-Jack: I think setting a deadline for sharing our targets and strategies is a great idea, Emma. How about we set a deadline for Friday of this week? That way, we can all have a chance to think about our strategies and share them with each other by then. Additionally, I'd like to suggest that we also establish a way to communicate with each other throughout the month, in case we need to make any adjustments to our plans. Maybe we can create a group chat or schedule a weekly call to check in with each other.\n-Luke: I think setting a deadline for sharing our targets and strategies is a great idea, Emma.
