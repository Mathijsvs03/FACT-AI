Maybe we can discuss a plan to ensure we don't overgraze the pasture and still earn a good income."], ["Kate", "I think John's idea of coordinating our efforts is a great one! I've been thinking about this too, and I've been considering a strategy where we take a smaller number of flocks to the pasture each, but do it consistently every month.

For example, if there are 80 hectares of grass left, we could take 20 flocks each. If there are 60 hectares left, we could take 15 flocks each.

It's a great way to balance our income with the health of the pasture.
