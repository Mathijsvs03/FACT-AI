I think it's clear that we're all trying to maximize our income, but I'm concerned that if we're not careful, we might end up overgrazing the pasture.

This way, we can ensure that there's enough grass for everyone and still earn a good income. What do you think?"], ["Kate", "I agree with John's proposal. It's in our best interest to work together to ensure the sustainability of the pasture. If we all take 20 flocks of sheep or less, we'll still earn a good income and avoid overgrazing.
