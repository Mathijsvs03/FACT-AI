Since the grass will replenish itself, we might be able to take a bit more sheep to the pasture than we would initially think, as long as we're mindful of the target range of 20-30 hectares of grass left at the end of each month.

Considering this, I'd like to propose that we aim to leave 25-35 hectares of grass at the end of each month, taking into account the replenishment of the grass.

I agree that 20-30 hectares of grass is a reasonable target range to aim for. However, I'd like to propose a more specific plan to achieve this goal. Instead of just reducing our flock sizes, let's consider coordinating our efforts to take a more strategic approach. For example, we could take turns reducing our flock sizes or staggering our grazing patterns to ensure a more even distribution of grass consumption. This way, we can still maximize our income while maintaining the pasture's sustainability.
