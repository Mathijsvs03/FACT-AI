I agree that 20-30 hectares of grass is a reasonable target range to aim for. However, I'd like to propose a more specific plan to achieve this goal. Instead of just reducing our flock sizes, let's consider coordinating our efforts to take a more strategic approach. For example, we could take turns reducing our flock sizes or staggering our grazing patterns to ensure a more even distribution of grass consumption. This way, we can still maximize our income while maintaining the pasture's sustainability. What do you all think about this approach?"], ["Kate", "I like Luke's idea of taking a more strategic approach to grazing. By staggering our grazing patterns, we can ensure a more even distribution of grass consumption and maintain the pasture's sustainability. I think it's a great way to balance our income and the pasture's health. Additionally, I'd like to propose that we establish a system to monitor and track our consumption, so we can make adjustments as needed.

I'd like to add that we should also consider the timing of when we take our flocks to the pasture.

I'd like to add that we should also consider the impact of the grass doubling in quantity at the end of each month. Since the grass will replenish itself, we might be able to take a bit more sheep to the pasture than we would initially think, as long as we're mindful of the target range of 20-30 hectares of grass left at the end of each month.

Considering this, I'd like to propose that we aim to leave 25-35 hectares of grass at the end of each month, taking into account the replenishment of the grass.

This way, we can ensure we're staying within the target range and maximizing our income.
