I'm glad I decided to catch 10 tons myself. I was worried that if we all caught too much, the lake population would shrink next month. But now that I see how much everyone else caught, I think we might be okay. Maybe we can even increase the population next month by catching less. What do you guys think?"], ["Kate", "Interesting point, John. I agree that we don't want to overfish and risk depleting the lake's population. I was thinking the same thing - maybe we can catch less next month to help increase the population. What do you guys think?"], ["Emma", "I think it's a good idea to catch less next month, but we also need to consider the income we can earn from fishing. If we catch too little, we might not be able to make a decent living. Maybe we can find a balance between catching enough to increase the population and earning a good income. What do you guys think?"], ["Luke", "Hmm, that's a good point Emma. I think we should definitely consider our income as well. Maybe we can aim to catch around 20-30 tons of fish next month, that way we can still increase the population while also earning a good income. What do you guys think?"], ["Kate", "I think it's important to consider the long-term effects of our actions on the lake's population. While it's important to earn a good income, we also need to make sure that the lake can sustain itself in the long run.
