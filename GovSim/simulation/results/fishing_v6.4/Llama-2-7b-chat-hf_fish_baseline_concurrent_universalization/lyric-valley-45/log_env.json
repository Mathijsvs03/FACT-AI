Determine whether there was an explicit agreement on a concrete fishing limit. Look for direct mention or agreement on a numerical catch limit that the group agreed to keep during this conversation.\n\nConversation:\n-Mayor: Ladies and gentlemen, let me give you the monthly fishing report. John caught 10 tons of fish. Kate caught 24 tons of fish. Jack caught 25 tons of fish. Emma caught 20 tons of fish. Luke caught 21 tons of fish. \n-John: Wow, that's a lot of fish caught! I'm glad I decided to catch 10 tons, it's better to be safe than sorry. But I have to say, I'm a bit concerned about the lake's population now. With so many fish caught, it might be difficult for the lake to reproduce next month. Have any of you considered that?\n-Emma: I understand your concern, John. I was thinking the same thing when I was deciding how much to catch. But I think we have to consider our own goals and priorities here. I want to maximize my income, and catching 20 tons of fish seemed like the best way to do that. I know it might affect the lake's population, but I think it's worth it in the long run. What do you think, Emma?\n-Kate: I think it's important to consider the long-term effects of our actions on the lake's population. While maximizing our income is important, we also have a responsibility to ensure the sustainability of the lake's resources. I think we should consider catching fewer fish this month to allow the lake to reproduce and maintain a healthy population in the future.\n\nPlease provide the specific fishing limit per person as agreed upon in the conversation, if no limit was agreed upon, please answer N\/A.
