Determine whether there was an explicit agreement on a concrete fishing limit. Look for direct mention or agreement on a numerical catch limit that the group agreed to keep during this conversation.\n\nConversation:\n-Mayor: Ladies and gentlemen, let me give you the monthly fishing report. John caught 10 tons of fish. Kate caught 29 tons of fish. Jack caught 22 tons of fish. Emma caught 20 tons of fish. Luke caught 19 tons of fish. \n-John: Wow, that's a lot of fish caught! I'm glad I decided to catch 10 tons myself. I was worried that if we all caught too much, the lake population would shrink next month. But now that I see how much everyone else caught, I think we might be okay. Maybe we can try to catch even less next month to make sure the lake stays healthy.\n-Kate: Hmm, I see what you mean, John. I was thinking the same thing. If we all catch too much, it could definitely have an impact on the lake's population next month. I think it's important for us to be mindful of that and try to catch a sustainable amount of fish. Maybe we can aim to catch around 20-30 tons each next month?\n-Emma: Interesting point, Kate. I think it's important for us to be mindful of the lake's population, especially since we're all trying to maximize our profits. I agree that catching too much could have negative consequences. Maybe we can aim to catch around 25-30 tons each next month, to give the lake some room to reproduce and maintain its population.\n\nPlease provide the specific fishing limit per person as agreed upon in the conversation, if no limit was agreed upon, please answer N\/A.

While the participants discussed the weight of fish they caught and the potential impact of catching too much on the lake's population, there was no direct mention or agreement on a numerical catch limit that the group agreed to keep. The closest approximation of a limit mentioned was Kate's suggestion of catching around 20-30 tons each next month, but this was not explicitly agreed upon by<\/div>","agent_name":"framework","resource_limit":20.0,"utterance":null}]
