I told you all that if we fish more than 10 tons, the lake population would shrink next month. And now, look what happened! We've all caught a significant amount, but the lake is now only half full. Next month, we'll have to be more mindful of our catch limits if we want to keep the lake healthy and profitable."], ["Kate", "Hey John, I have to agree with you. If we had caught fewer fish this month, the lake would have been less depleted, and we would have had more fish to catch next month. However, I'm not sure if we can all blame each other for overfishing. We're all just trying to make a living, and sometimes we get carried away. Maybe we should consider setting some catch limits for ourselves next month to ensure we don't overfish again. What do you think, Jack?"], ["Jack", "Hey Kate, I completely agree with you. Setting catch limits for ourselves next month is a great idea. I was thinking we could start by setting a collective limit of 80 tons for next month. That way, we can still make a good income without overfishing the lake. What do you think, Emma?"], ["Emma", "I completely agree with both of you. Setting a collective limit of 80 tons for next month is a great idea. It's essential to ensure we don't overfish the lake and maintain its health for future generations. However, I have to say, I'm a bit surprised by the amount of fish we caught this month. I mean, I knew the lake was full, but I didn't expect us to catch so much. Maybe we should consider spreading out our fishing spots next month to avoid overcrowding and increase our chances of catching more fish.
