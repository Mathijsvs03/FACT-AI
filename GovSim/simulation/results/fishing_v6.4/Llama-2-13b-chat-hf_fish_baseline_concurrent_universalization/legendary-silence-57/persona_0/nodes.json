With the lake's carrying capacity at 100 tons, and us catching over 100 tons combined this month, it's only a matter of time before we deplete the lake's resources.

We've been lucky this month, but we can't rely on sheer luck to sustain our livelihoods in the long run.

That way, we can ensure the lake's resources are sustainable for everyone's benefit."], ["Emma", "I couldn't agree more, Kate.
