I've been thinking about this too, and I think we should aim to leave some fish behind each month to ensure the lake's sustainability.

However, I'd like to suggest that we also consider the potential for variation in the lake's reproduction rate. We don't know for certain how many fish will be left after reproduction, so we should be prepared to adjust our target accordingly.

What do you all think?\n-Luke: I think Jack's suggestion to set a range of 75-85 tons of fish to leave in the lake each month is a great idea. It's a more flexible approach that takes into account the uncertainty of the lake's reproduction rate. I'm willing to work towards this goal and adjust as needed.

What do you all think?\n-Kate: I think Luke's proposal for a system to regularly monitor the lake's fish population is a great idea. It would help us stay informed and adapt to any changes in the lake's reproduction rate.
