Did you expect to catch that much?"], ["Emma", "Interesting, John. I was thinking the same thing. With the lake's carrying capacity being 100 tons, it's important to be mindful of how much we catch each month. I'm glad I only caught 24 tons this time around.

I didn't think about the lake's carrying capacity when deciding how much to catch. I'm glad I caught 50 tons this month, but I see what you're saying. Maybe we should aim to catch closer to the carrying capacity each month to ensure the fish population remains healthy."], ["Jack", "Interesting point, Kate. I think it's important to strike a balance between maximizing our catch and preserving the lake's fish population. Maybe we can aim to catch around 75 tons of fish on average each month to ensure a sustainable fish population while still earning a decent income."], ["Luke", "Hmm, that's a good point, Jack. I think it's important to consider the long-term sustainability of the lake's fish population. I'm glad we're having this conversation and thinking ahead.
